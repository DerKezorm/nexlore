"""What only nexlore's own user may read: the key, the database, the backups, the log.

A backup holds ``secret.key``, the database (password hashes, sealed secrets) and every note. Written with the
container's default umask they were readable for every user of the machine (0644 in 0755 folders): on a NAS share or
a host with other users, anybody could copy them. The vault itself is left as it is: Obsidian or Syncthing may work
on it as another user.

On Windows ``chmod`` knows only read-only; there everything here does nothing.
