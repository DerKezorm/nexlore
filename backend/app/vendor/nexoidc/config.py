"""What the module needs to know about the app it runs in.

The module imports nothing from an app. The app hands over what is its own business once at start-up, before the
first request, with ``configure(AppConfig(...))``: its name, its server secret, where its API lives, its public
address, whether it has only one account. Everything else (database, accounts, invitations, sessions) comes in
through the ``Store`` protocol (``model.py``) at the moment it is needed.

Tests replace the network with ``use_transport(httpx.MockTransport(...))``; nothing in the module then touches it.
