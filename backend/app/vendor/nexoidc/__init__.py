"""nexoidc: sign-in with OpenID Connect and the authentik button, the same in every nex app.

This package is copied unchanged into ``backend/app/vendor/nexoidc/`` of each app by ``bauplaene/oidc/tools/sync.py``
and changed only in ``bauplaene/oidc``. A test in every app compares the files with the checksums in ``MANIFEST.json``.

What lives here (Bauplan "Anmeldung mit OIDC und authentik", parts 01 to 03 and 06):

- ``config``: what the app tells the module about itself (``configure(AppConfig(...))``);
- ``model``: providers, links, identities, and the ``Store`` the app implements over its database;
- ``protocol``: discovery, ``same_issuer``, Entra's placeholder, PKCE, exchange, token checks, userinfo;
- ``attempt``: the signed attempt cookie and the single use of a ``state``;
- ``flow``: start and return as plain redirects and cookies;
- ``accounts``: who the identity is, linking, unlinking, the second factor;
- ``providers``: the provider list, issuer changes, removal;
- ``migrate``: from one provider in the settings to the list;
- ``coupling``: nexsuite as the provider of a coupled app, the own entries set aside and back;
- ``authentik``: the button and the blueprint.

Only httpx and PyJWT (with cryptography) are needed; nothing from an app is imported.
