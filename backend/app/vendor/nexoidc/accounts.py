The order on a return, and nothing else:

1. the link ``(provider_id, subject)``: found, signed in, whatever name and address the provider sends today;
2. the invitation in the attempt: a new account with the rights of the invitation, which is used up by one statement
   that must hit exactly one row (two people returning at once: only one gets in);
3. ``auto_create`` of the provider: a new account as a member;
4. otherwise refused with ``oidc_no_account``.

Never by the address, not even with ``email_verified: true``: authentik sends ``false`` by default, Entra sends none,
and in authentik everybody changes their own address. The address from the provider is kept at the link for display.
