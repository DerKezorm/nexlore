"""OpenID Connect itself (Bauplan 02): discovery, the address at the provider, the code exchange, the token checks,
userinfo. No accounts, no database, no cookies; ``flow.py`` puts these pieces together and ``accounts.py`` decides
who the identity is.

The flow is the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (S256), always. Why three random values although they look alike:
``state`` stops somebody from planting a foreign answer into a browser (CSRF on the return leg), ``nonce`` sits inside
the token and stops an intercepted id token from being redeemed a second time, and the PKCE ``verifier`` makes an
intercepted code worthless. On top of that every ``state`` is consumed once on the server (``attempt.py``).

No OIDC library: httpx fetches the documents, PyJWT checks the signatures. The standard is small enough to write out,
and a library would bring a second HTTP stack and a second reading of JWT.
