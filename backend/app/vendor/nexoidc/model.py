"""The data the module works with, and the ``Store`` the app implements over its own database.

The tables are the app's (Bauplan 01): ``oidc_providers`` and ``oidc_links`` with exactly the columns named there, in
the app's own models and migrations. The module never sees a database; it calls the ``Store`` methods below, and
the app answers them with SQLAlchemy, sqlite3 or whatever it uses. All methods are synchronous: every app runs its
database synchronously.

A ``Store`` works inside one transaction of the app. The module calls ``commit()`` once an outcome is settled and
``rollback()`` when it refuses after having written (a consumed invitation comes back that way). The app opens the
store per request and closes it afterwards.
