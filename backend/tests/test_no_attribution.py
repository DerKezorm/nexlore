"""Nothing in the repository names an AI assistant or its maker, and nothing carries a real name.

Two layers:

* Everywhere, CI included: the words an attribution is made of. They are put together from pieces here, so that
  this file does not trip the check itself.
* On a machine with the project's own scanner in ``.git/hooks/secret_scan.py`` (untracked, it holds the real names
  and the home network): that scanner over every file in full, not only over the lines a commit adds. A file that
  entered before the hook existed is caught here.

The files are the ones git would take: tracked plus untracked that are not ignored.
